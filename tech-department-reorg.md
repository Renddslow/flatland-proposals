<h1 id="tech-department-reorganization-proposal">Tech Department Reorganization Proposal</h1>
<p>Current structure:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Teams</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Audio Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Lights Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tech Overseer</td>
<td>Screens Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Video Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Loops and Charts Coord.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>In this current model the burden of scheduling and recruiting falls on an individual team leader with an specific skill-set for their current team. In addition, the current structure does not present any end-goal to recruitment, that is the team leader can easily feel daunted by the need to continuously recruit.</p>
<p>This new proposal would establish a new team structure based on the current Sunday needs. The new proposed department structure would look like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Teams</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Tech Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Tech Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tech Overseer</td>
<td>Tech Team Leader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Screens Prep Coord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Lighting Design Coord.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>In this new structure a Tech Team would be comprised of the following team members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Team Leader (Producer)</li>
<li>Audio Engineer</li>
<li>Screens Operator</li>
<li>Lighting Operator</li>
<li>Video Director</li>
<li>Camera Operator</li>
<li>Camera Operator</li>
</ul>
<p>In this model, each Tech Team Leader would be responsible for scheduling a recruiting for their full team. Each tech team then would be staggered weekly and have the same number of members. Over time as a team grows a new Tech Team Leader can be raised up and a new team spun off with them.</p>
<p>This model will further help us as we expand to multiple venues, allowing the Tech Overseer to lead a team of producers who are responsible for a given Sunday, versus many skill-specific team leaders.</p>
<p>Splitting screens and lighting prep into their own coordinator positions allows these roles, which are both mid-week roles, to be fully owned by an individual with aptitude without the need for leadership skills.</p>
